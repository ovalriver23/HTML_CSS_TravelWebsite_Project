            <h1>Hôtel Ritz Paris</h1>
            <p>
                The Ritz, Paris, is a by-word for glamour and luxury for good reason. An old favourite of Ernest Hemingway’s (rumour goes that he ‘liberated’ it at the end of the Second World War so he could get a drink), it reopened in 2016 after major four-year refurbishment more glitzy than ever. <br> <br>
                It’s Imperial Suite, a National Monument of France, has a bedroom replicating that of Marie Antoinette’s bedroom at Versailles, a grand salon, a dining room and another bedroom. If you fancy yourself in the style of one of the Lost Generation writers, this is the perfect backdrop for you!</p>

                    <h2>Architecture</h2> <br>
                    <p>The palace and the square are masterpieces of classical architecture from the end of the reign of Louis XIV. The façade was designed by the royal architect Mansart in the late 17th century before the plot was bought and construction began in 1705. The Hôtel Ritz comprises the Vendôme and the Cambon buildings with rooms overlooking the Place Vendôme, and, on the opposite side, the hotel's garden. <br> <br>
                        The Ritz was among the first hotels in Europe to provide a bathroom en suite, a telephone and electricity for each room. The Hôtel Ritz Paris is 4 floors high, including the mansard roof, and as of 2011 offers 159 rooms, a two-Michelin-starred restaurant, two bars and a casual dining restaurant.</p>
