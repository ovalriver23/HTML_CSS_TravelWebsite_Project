            <h1>Beverly Hills Hotel, Los Angeles</h1>
            <p>From venerable London grandeur to ‘The Pink Palace’ on Sunset Boulevard, whose history is interwoven with Hollywood and its golden age. This is where all the stars came to sleep and play when they were filming, from Marilyn Monroe to Grace Kelly. Liz Taylor and Richard Burton even had their honeymoon here; The Eagles based their Hotel California on stories from the hotel. <br> <br>
                While we love the marble bathrooms and light, comfortable rooms, it’s the outdoor and public spaces that really captured our hearts and imagination. Every bit as bright and breezy as you’d expect from Retro Hollywood, we could people-watch at the pool or on the terrace for days.</p>

                    <p>In 2001, LACMTA then proposed a bus rapid transit route down Santa Monica Blvd., but this was also opposed by the city and never built. This stretch of road is served by less efficient Metro Rapid buses using pre-existing roadways. By 2010, traffic in Beverly Hills and surrounding areas had deteriorated enough that the city's habitual opposition had largely turned to support for subways within the city limits. As part of the Westside Subway Extension project, the D Line of the LA Metro Rail was intended in 2013 to be extended through Beverly Hills, adding two underground stations at Wilshire/La Cienega and Wilshire/Rodeo by the 2020s.</p>
