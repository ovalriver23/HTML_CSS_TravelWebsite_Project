            <h1>St Regis New York City</h1>
            <p>
                This feels like one of the names dropped into conversation in American films to illustrate how wealthy and sophisticated the character is and when you walk through the doors to this classic hotel you can see why it’s become one of the more famous hotels in the world. It’s iconic façade on the streets of New York a mere four blocks from Central Park already sets your heart beating in recognition; inside you’ll find chandeliers, marble, burgundy brocade and gold gilding a-plenty. <br> <br>
                
                The decoration isn’t the only luxury thing going on here; every guest is also assigned a butler. Yup, you heard that right. Your butler will attend to your every need, whether it’s arranging taxis, booking tables or unpacking. So while he’s doing that, you can head to the cosy cocktail den, the King Cole Bar, for drinks. There are many, many famous hotels in New York, but this one has to be one of the most opulent.</p>

                    <p>The hotel has always had a number of permanent residents, as well as guests. The artist Salvador Dalí and his wife Gala lived at the hotel every fall and winter from 1966 to 1973. William Paley and his wife Babe maintained an apartment there, as did Marlene Dietrich. In Donald Spoto's biography of Alfred Hitchcock, The Dark Side of Genius, he states that Hitchcock stayed in "his favorite" 5th floor suite at least a dozen times. John Lennon recorded a demo of "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" in his room. Nikola Tesla resided at the hotel in 1922.</p>
