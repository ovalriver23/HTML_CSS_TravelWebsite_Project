        <h1>Hotel Sacher Vienna</h1>
        <p>
            From the sleek and modern hotels to the grandly historic, this elegant five-star hotel in Vienna’s first district is worth visiting only for its stories and its speciality Sachertorte – even if you can’t stretch to the cost of a room! Opened by the Sacher confectioner family in the late 19th century, Hotel Sacher has had eccentric owners, risked bankruptcy and appeared in The Third Man after Graham Greene was a bar regular – and these are only a few of the tales associated with its long history.</p>

            <h2>In popular culture</h2> <br>
            <p>Anna Sacher and her hotel were memorialised in Dennis Wheatley's 1950 novel about the outbreak of the First World War, The Second Seal. Appearing as herself, she plays a fictional role in the events of June/July 1914 in Vienna, aiding the book's hero the Duke de Richleau at several points. <br> <br>

                The hotel also found fame in the German-speaking world via the 1939 film Hotel Sacher, as well as by the popular Austrian TV series Hallo – Hotel Sacher … Portier!, starring Fritz Eckhardt. Romy Schneider stayed at Hotel Sacher during the shooting of Sissi in 1955. Director Ernst Marischka allegedly had been inspired by her resemblance to a statue of Empress Elisabeth in the hotel.The 2016 Austrian historical drama television series Das Sacher revolved around fictional events in the hotel.
