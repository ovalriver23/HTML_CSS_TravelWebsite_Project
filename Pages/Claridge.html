            <h1>Claridge’s London</h1>
            <p>
                Often described as the ‘first hotel in London’, Claridge’s has maintained its quality and prestige since its founding in 1812. Over the years it has hosted many well-known guests including so many members of royalty that it’s been called an ‘annexe to Buckingham Palace.’ A mere 10-minute walk from Hyde Park and in the hub of London’s shopping district, you find a welcoming, intimate atmosphere in the stylish rooms of the hotel. <br> <br>
                Our favourite part is the 1930s Fumoir – a former cigar bar – where you can enjoy the sumptuous surroundings with a perfectly-mixed cocktail in hand. With the impeccable décor, amazing service and Art Deco touches, it’s no wonder this is one of the most famous hotels in the world.</p>

                  <h2>Founding</h2> <br>
                  <p>Claridge's was founded in 1812 as Mivart's Hotel, in a conventional London terraced house, and it grew by expanding into neighbouring houses. In 1854, the founder (the father of biologist St. George Jackson Mivart) sold the hotel to a Mr and Mrs Claridge, who owned a smaller hotel next door. They combined the two operations, and after trading for a time as "Mivart's late Claridge's", they settled on the current name. The reputation of the hotel was confirmed in 1860 when Empress Eugenie made an extended visit and entertained Queen Victoria at the hotel.

                    In its first edition of 1878, Baedeker's London listed Claridge's as "The first hotel in London".</p>
